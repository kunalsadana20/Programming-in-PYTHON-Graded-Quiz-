    "**Hot Potato Problem**:In this game, a group of people line up in a circle, and once the music starts, players pass an object(say a ball or a potato) to the next person and keep doing that as long as the music is still playing. The moment the music stops, whoever has the ball in their hand will be removed from the circle, and the next round of the game starts. The loop continues until only one player is left and that person is declared the winner.\n",

    "To implement the logic using a queue, we need to implement the following steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store the given list of players in a queue. Assume the object is with the player at the front of the queue.\n",
    "- The number of passes, after which a player is eliminated is taken as an input. *For simplicity, we'll assume that this number is **constant**.*\n",
    "- Perform the necessary enqueue and dequeue operations based on the number of passes to denote each round of elimination where a player is removed from the queue and the object is with the next person who'll start the subsequent round. *The last person remaining will be declared as winner.*\n",
